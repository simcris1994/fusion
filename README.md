FUSION

This a mini project, made for fun. It's supposed to work like a music player that provides some visualisation in tune with the music.

Made in Python, using the librosa library for audio processing. I use the pygame library for displaying the animation.

## Prerequisites

In order to run the program, you must have the following dependencies installed: pygame, numpy, librosa, ffmpeg (needed for librosa to open mp3 files).

You'll also need to place your sound file under the root folder and name it "sound.mp3".

## How to run

From the root folder, run "python main.py".
